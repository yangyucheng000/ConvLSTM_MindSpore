## Environmental requirements

```
Hardware Platform: CPU / GPU / Ascend

Third Party Libraries:
mindspore = 1.6.1
numpy = 1.20.1

Dataset: mnist_test_seq.npy (https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/moving-mnist)
```

## How to run

Training:

```shell
python train.py							# Not using pretrained model parameters
python train.py --pretrain model.ckpt	# Use pretrained model parameters (the model was saved for epoch 100)
```

Evaluation:

```
python eval.py
```
